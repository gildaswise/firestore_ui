# firestore_ui

This project started as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/pull/757) to the official [cloud_firestore](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/cloud_firestore) plugin, but unfortunately they are still polishing the main features and this had to be postponed.

But fear not, my fellow Cloud Firestore users, this is a package that extracted the main code from that PR and now it's available to use!

Check out the example for more info, it should be pretty straight forward since it's just a port of [firebase_auth](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_auth)'s version.
